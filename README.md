# 🩸 Blood Cancer Detection Using CNN

A deep learning-based web application for detecting blood cancer using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The application is containerized with Docker and easily deployable using Docker Compose.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Blood smear image upload and prediction
- Trained CNN model (`weights.hdf5`) for accurate detection
- Flask-based web interface
- Dockerized setup for smooth deployment

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- CNN (Keras/TensorFlow)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Docker & Docker Compose

---

## 📁 Repository Highlights
